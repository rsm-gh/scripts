VERSION 0.0

The program is a simple wolf & sheeps game for the terminal. Wolfs eat sheeps, and sheeps eat grass. Everything is animated by random functions and the game ends when all the animals are death.

I had to do this program for the university. The most part of the code had to be written in French. There are some improvements that could be made, but the code works fine.

To compile the program you can use "javac *.java", and to run the program "java Main".
